Quora no login extension for Firefox
====================================

Do you avoid quora pages because you don't want to login or create an account just to read the page?
If so, this plugin is for you. This plugin allows you to bypass the annoying login popup and displays
the page content unblurred.

Installing
----------

Download the latest release of `quora-nologin.xpi` from [here](https://github.com/juggernaut/quora-nologin/releases) and open it in Firefox.

How it works
------------

The plugin adds a `share=1` parameter to all Quora URLs. This is the recommended method for sharing by Quora. See http://blog.quora.com/Making-Sharing-Better
